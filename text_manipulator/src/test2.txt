Three Little pigs was sent out into the world by their mother to learn.

The three pigs, all decided to build a house on their own.
The first pig built a house of straw because he didn't want to put in a lot of effort and was lazy.
The second pig was a little less lazy than the first and he made a house of sticks.
The third pig was hardworking and he put in lots of effort and built a house of brick and stone.
One day a wolf came to attack them. He huffed and puffed and blew the house of straw.
He then huffed and puffed and blew the house the sticks.
He huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed at the house of bricks but eventually was out of breath and left.
Moral of the story
Always work hard and it will pay off. Donâ€™t try to take shortcuts to make things work.
