OCaml Coding Information
We are using OCaml version 5.0.0.

Installing OCaml 5.0.0 and associated tools
We require that you use the opam packaging system for installing OCaml and its 
extensions. 
Once you get opam installed and working, everything else should be easy to 
install .. so the only hard part is the first step.

For Linux or Mac see The OPAM install page for install instructions.
For Mac users, the above requires Homebrew (a package manager for Linux-ish 
libraries) so here is a more detailed suggestion of some copy/paste that should work.
Mac without homebrew installed:/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubuserconte
nt.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" will install Homebrew
if you get “Error: homebrew-core is a shallow clone.” from the above follow the 
instructions and be prepared to wait awhile (the whole git history needs to be loaded thanks to github idiocy)
Mac with Homebrew already installed: brew update; brew install gpatch; brew install opam
For Windows you should use WSL2, the Windows Subsystem for Linux. It creates a 
Linux-like system from within Windows.
Once you install WSL 2 you will be able to follow the Linux Ubuntu install instructions 
linked above.
Note that your WSL2 Ubuntu needs the C compiler and tools for the opam install to work; 
the following Linux shell command will get you those: sudo apt install make m4 gcc 
unzip bubblewrap.
You can still use your Windows install of VSCode to edit files by using the VSCode 
Remote WSL Extension – it will connect the Windows editor to the underlying WSL2 
subsystem. See below where VSCode is described for details on how to set this up.
WSL2 has been working well for most people, but another option is to set up a Linux VM 
on your Windows box, and then set up a Linux install of OCaml within the VM. There are 
many good tutorials on how to build a Linux VM, here is one of them. Once your virtual 
Linux box is set up, you can follow the opam Linux install instructions.
